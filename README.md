## FitCity

FitCity is a fitness platform that allows users to discover gyms and trainers in their city, book personal training sessions, and purchase monthly gym memberships. Members can chat with trainers, receive real-time notifications, and pay for services using cash or card. Gym administrators manage members, trainers, payments, and control gym access via QR code check-ins, while system administrators oversee all data and manage gyms displayed on the city map. The application provides an end-to-end solution for gym discovery, booking, payments, and access management.
